### Data set:

 - [OpenBarbell](https://github.com/squatsandsciencelabs/OpenBarbell-V3/wiki/OpenBarbell-Data-Storage-Format)
 - See [Readme.md](https://github.com/YuliaZamriy/W207_Group_Project/blob/master/Project_Overview.md) for more details
 - The dataset is provided by [Squats and Science Barbell](http://squatsandscience.com/), no NDA is required per owner (Jordan Berke)

### Dependent variables:

 1. Exercise name (squat, bench press, deadlift)
 2. Lifter segmentation

### Project goals:

 1. *Exercise classification*. Exercise name is an open field (lifters can enter whatever they want or nothin at all). However, it is one of the key variables to analyze lifter performance. Hence, we would like to build an algorithm to determine exercise for each set based on its characteristics (weight, range of motion, velocity etc.)
 2. *Lifter segmentation*. Can we create distinct groups of lifters based on their lifting characteristics for each exercise (velocity, range of motion, weight)? This would help create semi-customized training programs.
